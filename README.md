External Bias & Opinion Clustering in Cooperative Networks
Mentor : Dr. Twinkle Tripathy , EE Dept , IITK
◦ We study the effect of external bias factors on the evolution of opinions in a cooperative network with arbitrary connectivity
◦ The research demonstrates that by designing appropriate control inputs, it’s possible to achieve any desired opinion pattern, such as
consensus or polarization, and mitigate the effects of external biases
